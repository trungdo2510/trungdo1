  <h1>The story in book</h1>
  <h2>Chaper 1</h2>
  <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature,<br> New Scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The<br> Road</i>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she<br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
  <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that<br> Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do. Although many considered her pioneering work,<br> unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something<br> better to do.</p>
